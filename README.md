# OPS2LSDYNA
OPS2DYNA: convert from .out (OpenSEES output) to .key (LS-DYNA input)

OPS2LSDYNA is write by NAN Zhuojun & DAI Xu to creat Thermal input LS-DYNA Keywork File

* The OPS2LSDYNA files are in the folder Baseline_OPS/Baseline. (write in Python)
* After convert the .key files (with temperature history curves) are ready to be included in the main structural model.
* The case used in example is the baseline scenario which is based on the BST/FRS 1993 Fire Test Series.
* Illustration are figures to help undertand the process and principle of convert.
* When we publish this OPS2LSDYNA, the LSDYNA model (i.e. Baseline_LSDYNA) should be delete.
